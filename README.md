# Bivariate Simplicial Depth: Explicit Expression, Computation and Applications
## Explicit Bivariate Simplicial Depth
Detailed calculations of the explicit population SD formulas (Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 3.3) for uniform distributions on convex polygons (or their boundaries) are provided in MATHEMATICA notebook SDsupplementary.nb.  
## Counting the number of $k$-simplices containing the origin
Implementation of the algorithm presented in Section 4.1 can be found in R script CountSD_K.R
## Exact sample SD of the entire plane
Implementation of the algorithm presented in Section 4.2 can be found in MATHEMATICA notebook SDcells.nb.
